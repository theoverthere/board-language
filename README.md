# board-language
This is the repository for BoardLang, a language for creating custom board games

Using BoardLang:
VSCode was used as the editor to make this project and is what I would recommend using for BoardLang.

To start making a BoardLang program you must first create a custom .baord file in the directory you are making your project in. Download grammar.tx, interpreter.py, and run_model.py from the repository. When you have your .board program filled out you will run the command: "python run_model.py" in the VSCode terminal. In order for this command to work make sure that in run_model.py you have the correct .board file loaded into the interpreter.

Notes: 
Currently, BoardLang only supports simulating Monopoly games but could be expanded in the future to support many popular board games.
